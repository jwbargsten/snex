3000.1.1  2022-09-13  Joachim Bargsten  <jw@bargsten.org>
  - Switch to semantic versioning. Because dates were used before, we start with 3000 as major version.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: switch from HOCON to yaml as config file format. The
    reliance on https://github.com/chimpler/pyhocon as dependency was not worth
    it. With yaml we shave off quite some deps without any impact to the
    expressiveness of the config file.
